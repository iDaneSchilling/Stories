# Stories

This is a repo to share some creepy but true stories. We know we can't verify them, but we hope people tell stories that are as close to the truth as possible. I would love for anyone to share their stories, just open a PR. If that isn't something you feel comfortable doing, then hop over to the discussions tab and share it there.
