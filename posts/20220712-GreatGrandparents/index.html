        There were always stories of hauntings in my life. The one I'm going to tell you now is 100% true, without a doubt as it happened to me personally. As a child, I was always with my grandma. We would sleep in the same room. Not the same bed, just the room. I have always had trouble sleeping. One night I was looking around listening to grandma snore. I looked out on the screen porch at the washer and dryer. I had to take a second look because there were two people sitting on the washer and dryer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I finally decided that it was clothes piled on the washer. I finally fell asleep and didn't even think about going to the porch to see what was there. I woke up the next morning and ran to the porch and there was nothing there. I walked into the kitchen and told my grandma. She told me not to worry as it was only her mom & dad. They were my great grandma & grandpa. This was only the beginning. After seeing them it opened up to seeing other things.

        I would wake up at night to the clicking of the stove. Grandma had a gas stove that would make a clicking noise before the stove lights. Then the lights will go on and off. The pots and pans start banging together. The water would go on & off. Sometimes I could smell bacon cooking & hear the popping of the bacon. I would wake up at day break and run into the kitchen excited to see pots & pans in the sink and grease on the stove. This happened everytime I stayed the night. I loved staying there. My great grandparents were a part of my life.
